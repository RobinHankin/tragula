Dear Professor Erickson

I am launching a new journal, Tragula, which focusses on computers and
software in the fields of recreational and pure mathematics.  The idea
is that submissions add value to the R community through mathematics,
or conversely add value to the mathematical community through use of R
(or preferably both).  There seems to be no peer-reviewed outlet for
publishing work of this type.

I am currently trying to appoint an editorial board, and I was
attracted your wide range of publications on the boundary between
pure or recreational mathematics and computer science (in particular,
I enjoyed the paper on walking one's dog in the woods).  I also
wholeheartedly endorse your stance on Elsevier.  I thought you would
be perfect for the role.  Would you be interested in this?  Let me
know either way or if you have any comments or suggestions.

Editors will handle no more than 2-3 submissions per year.  Would you
be interested in this?  If so, let me know and I'd be happy to send
you the guidelines to authors that sets out editorial policy in a bit
more detail.

With best wishes

Robin
