Dear Professor Joyner

I am launching a new journal, Tragula, which focusses on computers and
software in the fields of recreational and pure mathematics.  The idea
is that submissions add value to the R community through mathematics,
or conversely add value to the mathematical community through use of R
(or preferably both).  There seems to be no peer-reviewed outlet for
publishing work of this type.

I am currently trying to appoint an editorial board.  I am a big fan
of your excellent 'Adventures in Group theory' book (and have cited it
many times!), and indeed your work on sage; I thought you would be
perfect for the role.  Would you be interested in this?  Let me know
either way or if you have any comments or suggestions.

Editors will handle no more than 2-3 submissions per year.  If you'd
like to be involved, let me know and I'd be happy to send you the
guidelines to authors that sets out editorial policy in a bit more
detail.
