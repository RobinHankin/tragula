Dear Romain

I am launching a new journal, Tragula, which focusses on computers and
software in the fields of recreational and pure mathematics.  The idea
is that submissions add value to the R community through mathematics,
or conversely add value to the mathematical community through use of R
(or preferably both).  There seems to be no peer-reviewed outlet for
publishing work of this type.

I am currently trying to appoint an editorial board, and I was
attracted to a professional R enthusiast.  I thought you would be
exactly the kind of person I am looking for.  Would you be interested
in this?  Let me know either way or if you have any comments or
suggestions.

Editors will handle no more than 2-3 submissions per year.  If you'd
like to be involved, let me know and I'd be happy to send you the
guidelines to authors that sets out editorial policy in a bit more
detail.
